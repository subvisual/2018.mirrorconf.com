**Who it’s for**


  Whether you’re in client services, or a freelancer, working at a startup, or a
  big company, you’ll learn something from this workshop. Heck, you don’t even
  have to be a designer to get something out of this. Whether you call yourself
  a visual designer, a graphic designer, a web designer, an interaction
  designer, a developer, an engineer, a product manager, a photographer, a
  casual blogger, or a modern dance enthusiast, there will be something in this
  workshop that will make you better at your craft.




  **What you’ll learn**


  We will look at ways to communicate and apply these fundamentals to every
  aspect of your job. The goal is to expand your view of your job as a designer
  to include not just your talent, but the business and communication aspects as
  well. It contains all the information about earning a living, selling design,
  and interacting with clients that your school should have taught you but
  didn’t.


  We’ll go over basic conversation skills, common red flags to look for in
  client interactions, how to price your work and value your time. From
  contracts to selling design, from working with clients to working with each
  other, you’ll learn why navigating the business of design is just as important
  as the craft of it.


  If you’ve read Design Is a Job, this workshop is the perfect complement. If
  you haven’t, it’s a great introduction.


  We’ll have fun. We’ll laugh. We’ll cry. We’ll tell stories. And we’ll all
  leave with a better understanding of how to do this job better for both
  ourselves, our companies, and our clients.
