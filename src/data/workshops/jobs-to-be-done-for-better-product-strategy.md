  What are the real reasons users choose one product over another? How can we find out if we are truly meeting their needs? Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) theory provides a way to unpack the complex motivations in why someone might “hire” a product to do a “job” and methods to pinpoint strategic opportunities. Originating in market research and strategy, Jobs-to-Be-Done is an approach that is rapidly being recognised and adopted by product teams and UX practitioners worldwide as an effective way to identify and define user needs.

What are the real reasons users choose one product over another? How can we find out if we are truly meeting their needs? Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) theory provides a way to unpack the complex motivations in why someone might “hire” a product to do a “job” and methods to pinpoint strategic opportunities. Originating in market research and strategy, Jobs-to-Be-Done is an approach that is rapidly being recognised and adopted by product teams and UX practitioners worldwide as an effective way to identify and define user needs.

* How to write lightweight script for Switch interviews
* Undertaking high-level analysis using JTBD timeline and forces
* How to combine the Switch interview with other UX methods
* Job stories, job statements, outcome statements and how you might use them in a product context
* Demand thinking and the development of jobs-as-progress

Anyone who is involved in the strategic direction or the design of a product will get value out of this workshop. You can be a product owner, product manager, researcher, designer or developer. If you care about building the right thing, this workshop is for you.
