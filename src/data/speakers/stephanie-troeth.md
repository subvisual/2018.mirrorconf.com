## Independent Strategist and Researcher

Steph is an independent strategist and researcher. She was most recently the
Head of Research at digital agency Clearleft, where she helped companies and
organisations build customer intelligence through combining design research
with other disciplines. Previously, she led design research at the Telegraph
and spearheaded European customer research with MailChimp.

In 20 years of working in the digital industry, Steph has worn many hats,
including a product lead for a startup in digital publishing and a director of
technology at a digital agency. She is also a regular speaker at conferences
and guest lectures annually at the University of Greenwich. When not bound to
a digital device, she makes things by hand, grows edible flowers and has a
tendency to cook enough to feed a continent at a time. She now lives on her
4th continent on her 4th island in the UK.
