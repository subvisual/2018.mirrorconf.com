## Independent Strategist and Researcher

Steph is an independent strategist and researcher. She was most recently the
Head of Research at digital agency Clearleft, where she helped companies and
organisations build customer intelligence through combining design research
with other disciplines. Previously, she led design research at the Telegraph
and spearheaded European customer research with MailChimp.

In 20 years of working in the digital industry, Steph has worn many hats,
including a product lead for a startup in digital publishing and a director of
technology at a digital agency. She is also a regular speaker at conferences
and guest lectures annually at the University of Greenwich. When not bound to
a digital device, she makes things by hand, grows edible flowers and has a
tendency to cook enough to feed a continent at a time. She now lives on her
4th continent on her 4th island in the UK.

## Behind the Story

Storytelling” appears to be a magic word when it comes to creating user
experience—we use it to evoke design ideals, to summon the creative spirit, or
to cry out for a narrative link across the complex world of devices and short
attention spans.  In the context of design, we often talk about using the
three-act structure, characters, and how conflict is a key essential ingredient.
But is it all there is?

Steph spent a few years learning from the art of making documentaries, crime
fiction, novels and the shortest of stories.  In this session, Steph will show
how understanding the essence and practice of story opens a world of
possibilities and adds another dimension to your UX toolset. Better still, it’s
less of a mystery than what you might think.
