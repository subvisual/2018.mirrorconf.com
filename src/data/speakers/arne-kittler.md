## Clarity in Collaboration

It’s no secret that good cross-disciplinary collaboration between Programmers, Designers and Product People is the way to build strong products. Not only that, it’s also a great opportunity for everybody involved to broaden their horizons and learn from new perspectives. And if you work in a larger organization you will also most likely collaborate across teams which adds another layer of new perspectives and potentials for building products people love. But let’s face it: Collaboration is also difficult. And while some difficulties & frictions are certainly worth going through for the sake of a better results there are other aspects that we could all happily avoid. In particular I’m talking about missing clarity and its consequences in misunderstandings & bad blood as well as the resulting inefficiencies or untapped potentials.

I have build digital products as part of cross-disciplinary teams for more than 17 years and especially in the last 7 years of my work at XING learned to appreciate clarity as one keen ingredient for better results and more fun in collaboration. The interesting thing about clarity is that while it may seem obvious that clarity is better than lack thereof, we often lack clarity in collaboration. So why is that? How can be notice a lack of clarity early on? And what can we do to get more clarity into our collaboration within our team as well as when collaborating between several teams?

In my talk I will look at different aspects of clarity, including role clarity, clarity of intent, clarity in conflict and clarity in communication. For each of these aspects I will reflect on why we avoid clarity, show you how you can easily spot when there’s a lack of clarity and propose ways how you can actively change this for the sake of better collaboration.

One of the main messages of this talk is that no matter what your role or your organizational setup is you can actively push for clarity and should not rely on others to do it for you.
