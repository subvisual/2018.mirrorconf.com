## Bringing Personality Back To The Web

Generic web layouts have become somewhat of a misnomer in conversations circling
around web design these days. As creatives, we’re bored and slightly annoyed by
how predictable and uninspired most web experiences have become. How do we break
out of predictable and boring designs without breaking the usability and
functionality of our experiences?

In this talk, Vitaly Friedman, the co-founder of Smashing Magazine, will shed
some light into a strategy of how to bring personality back to web design, and
how we can make our experiences more humane while also having a higher ROI.
Beware: you might not be able to unlearn what you’ll learn in this session.
Bonus: you’ll see some slightly dirty examples of things being done out there,
so bring along some pragmatism to this talk.
