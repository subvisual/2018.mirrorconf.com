## Head of Front-End Development, Behance and Adobe Portfolio

Jackie Balzer writes CSS like itâ€™s her job (it is). She is the Head of Front end Development for Behance at Adobe in NYC. She loves bringing designs to life with code.


## Preprocessors, Components, and CSS in JS or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Website

Behance's codebase has existed in various states for over 8 continuous years - which includes multiple major redesigns, brand overhauls, CSS preprocessors, JavaScript frameworks, templating languages, feature births and deaths, product integrations, and more.

And now, we are working on our latest project: building out a full redesign while moving our Sass and JavaScript to CSS Modules and Vue.js.

This talk explores our journey over the years, from how we choose which technologies to implement, how we piecemeal large rewrites while maintaining developer sanity and website integrity (and how to cut corners gracefully), how our developers and designers work together to ensure product quality, and most importantly, how to be at peace with the reality of a fragmented codebase.
