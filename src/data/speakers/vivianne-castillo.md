## UX Researcher. Humanity & Diversity in tech Advocate-Warrior

I’m a UX Researcher with 7 years of psychology and research experiences spanning multiple contexts, cultures, and industries and am an advocate for prioritizing empathy and humanity in design, and for synthesizing complex research into intuitive, simple systems. Prior to becoming a UX Researcher, I worked primarily in the arenas of trauma counseling, tackling issues like shame, empathy, vulnerability and compassion. My unique experiences as a human services professional, my multi-cultural upbringing, and my love for psychology have been major influences in my approach to UX Research and allow me to embody the term “human-centered design” by bringing these disciplines together to ensure that design is made with humanity.

I was a speaker at Lever’s first Diversity & Inclusion Forum in San Francisco last year, alongside the Heads of Diversity and Inclusion at places like Lyft, Netflix, and Atlassian. I was also an O’Reilly Diversity & Inclusion Scholar in 2017, and was named as a TED Resident finalist this spring after presenting an idea related to design that I desired to share with the rest of the world. For 2018, I am currently scheduled to speak at CanUX in Ottawa, The Radical Research Summit in Vancouver, and a remote talk to Atlassian in San Francisco.

Aside from that, I grew up celebrating Korean New Year (my mom is half Korean) and I’ve won 5 (yes, five!) vacations in my lifetime! I’ve also played my trumpet in concert on the Great Wall of China, I once found $950 on the sidewalk, and my mom once made me write a paper on how I can take more initiative with my life when I was seven years old.

## Ethics & Power: Understanding the Role of Shame in UX Research

We are overdue for a much-needed conversation on bias and privilege within the UX Industry’s culture, but we can’t achieve this conversation without addressing one of its core barriers: shame. If designers and front-end developers are to be truly human-centered and empathy-driven in their work, they not only need to fight to have a seat at the table with UX Researchers, but they are ethically and professionally responsible for the experiences they create without acknowledging the role of bias, privilege, and shame in their work. Dr. Brene Brown once said, “You have comfort and you have courage, but you can’t have both at the same time. Choose.” By the end of this talk designers and front-end developers will no longer be able to sit on the side lines of this critical conversation, instead, they’ll find themselves pursuing courage over comfort in both the professional and personal space of their lives.
