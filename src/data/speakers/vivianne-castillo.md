## UX Researcher. Humanity & Diversity in tech Advocate-Warrior

I’m a UX Researcher with 7 years of psychology and research experiences spanning multiple contexts, cultures, and industries and am an advocate for prioritizing empathy and humanity in design, and for synthesizing complex research into intuitive, simple systems. Prior to becoming a UX Researcher, I worked primarily in the arenas of trauma counseling, tackling issues like shame, empathy, vulnerability and compassion. My unique experiences as a human services professional, my multi-cultural upbringing, and my love for psychology have been major influences in my approach to UX Research and allow me to embody the term “human-centered design” by bringing these disciplines together to ensure that design is made with humanity.

I was a speaker at Lever’s first Diversity & Inclusion Forum in San Francisco last year, alongside the Heads of Diversity and Inclusion at places like Lyft, Netflix, and Atlassian. I was also an O’Reilly Diversity & Inclusion Scholar in 2017, and was named as a TED Resident finalist this spring after presenting an idea related to design that I desired to share with the rest of the world. For 2018, I am currently scheduled to speak at CanUX in Ottawa, The Radical Research Summit in Vancouver, and a remote talk to Atlassian in San Francisco.

Aside from that, I grew up celebrating Korean New Year (my mom is half Korean) and I’ve won 5 (yes, five!) vacations in my lifetime! I’ve also played my trumpet in concert on the Great Wall of China, I once found $950 on the sidewalk, and my mom once made me write a paper on how I can take more initiative with my life when I was seven years old.
