## Digital Anthropologist

Amber Case studies the interaction between humans and computers and how our

understand their worlds. Case is currently a fellow at Harvard University’s
[Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society] and a visiting researcher at
the [MIT Center for Civic Media].

A TED speaker and author, Case enjoys meeting and interacting with interesting
audiences all over the world. Her speeches range from the future of technology
and humanity to telecom, location-based applications and anthropology.

## Designing Calm Technology

Our world is made of information that competes for our attention. What is needed? What is not? We cannot interact with our everyday life in the same way we interact with a desktop computer. The terms calm computing and calm technology were coined in 1995 by PARC Researchers Mark Weiser and John Seely Brown in reaction to the increasing complexities that information technologies were creating. Calm technology describes a state of technological maturity where a user’s primary task is not computing, but being human. The idea behind Calm Technology is to have smarter people, not things. Technology shouldn’t require all of our attention, just some of it, and only when necessary.
How can our devices take advantage of location, proximity and haptics to help improve our lives instead of get in the way? How can designers can make apps “ambient” while respecting privacy and security? This talk will cover how to use principles of Calm Technology to design the next generation of connected devices. We’ll look at notification styles, compressing information into other senses, and designing for the least amount of cognitive overhead.
