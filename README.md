MirrorConf 2018 (under construction)
====================================

Welcome to the MirrorConf's 2018 edition _under construction_ page. You can find
it at [https://retro.2018.mirrorconf.com](https://retro.2018.mirrorconf.com).

MirrorConf is a conference that aims to blur the differences and point towards
a collaborative future between designers and front-end developers.

In 2018, our theme was _The Future of the Web_. As we planned this site, and
figured out what we wanted to do with it, we decided it should honor a tradition
of the early days of the Web -- the _under construction_ placeholder page.

We made this an homage to every brilliant piece of madness we could think from
those days. We made it simple, nonsensical, and we loved it.

This event is now part of that past, but this pearl will forever be dear to us.
We can't see how you would possibly find a useful purpose for it, but then again
that might just be the idea. :squirrel:
